# Practical-Ethical-Hacking-Lab-Series

## Project Overview

This repository documents my hands-on ethical hacking lab series, focused on practical exploitation, privilege escalation, credential harvesting, and post-exploitation techniques in controlled lab environments.

Each lab includes technical walkthroughs, proof-of-concepts, command breakdowns, and security insights.

The series is published on Medium <a href="https://infosecwriteups.com/">(via InfoSec Write-ups)</a> and distributed through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7257285066370813952/?displayConfirmation=true">LinkedIn ethical hacking lab newsletter</a>.

## Each lab is documented with:

- Step-by-step methodology

- Technical explanations

- Screenshots and proof of concepts

- Defensive insights

All articles are published on Medium and curated under the InfoSec Write-ups cybersecurity publication.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate practical offensive security skills

- Document real-world attack workflows

- Build structured red team methodology

- Share educational cybersecurity content publicly
